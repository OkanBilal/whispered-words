# Whispered Words (In Development)

Whispered Words is a web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), integrating [OpenAI's Whisper AI](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/), an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, for efficient and accurate voice transcription. This project allows users to upload voice recordings from a client interface, which are then processed on the server to provide text transcriptions.

## Features
- **Voice Recording Upload**: Users can easily upload their voice recordings through a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Whisper AI Integration**: Leverages the power of OpenAI's Whisper AI for high-accuracy voice-to-text transcription.
- **Secure and Private**: Ensures user data privacy and employs secure data transmission protocols.
